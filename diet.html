      <h2>The Importance of Diet in Fitness</h2>
      <p>When it comes to fitness, your diet is the most important part. The quality of food you eat determines how you feel, and the quantity determines how you look. Every person has a maintenance calorie level – the number of calories your body needs each day to maintain its current weight. If you eat above that number, you’re in a caloric surplus. If you eat below it, you’re in a caloric deficit. Eating around that number means you are maintaining your current weight.</p>

      <p>Tracking calories is the most accurate way to achieve your fitness goals, but it’s optional. As long as you have a general idea of how much you’re consuming daily, that can work too. If you want to track your calories, we recommend using <strong>MyNetDiary</strong> or <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong>. Out of the two, MyNetDiary is the better option because it includes features like barcode scanning without requiring a paid subscription, making it easier to log your food.</p>

      <p>If your goal is to lose weight, a caloric deficit is the only natural and effective method. Don’t fall for teas or supplements that promise fat loss — they don’t work. This is thermodynamics. You can’t cheat physics.</p>

      <p>Before you begin, first find your maintenance calories. Go to <a href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html" target="_blank">calculator.net</a> and enter your age, height, gender, and activity level. Be brutally honest with your input to get the most accurate estimate. Remember, it’s just a guideline — results vary per individual.</p>

      <p>Once you have your maintenance calories, it’s time to choose a goal. Do you want to get rid of excess fat? Put on muscle and gain weight? Or maybe you fall somewhere in between — not quite skinny, not quite overweight.</p>

      <p>One crucial component of any diet is <strong>protein</strong>. Protein takes longer to digest, which helps you feel full longer. This is extremely helpful during fat loss phases. Protein is also essential for maintaining and building muscle, especially when you’re in a deficit.</p>

      <p>Another key macronutrient is <strong>carbohydrates</strong>. Don’t eliminate carbs from your diet just because someone said they’re bad for weight loss. If you are in a deficit, your body will burn a mix of carbs (glycogen) and fat for energy. Carbs are our body’s preferred fuel source because they are the fastest macronutrient to break down, whereas protein digests more slowly. Carbs fuel your workouts and recovery — you need them.</p>

      <h2>Caloric Deficit / Fat Loss</h2>
      <p>To lose fat, you must be in a caloric deficit — meaning you consume fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight. One pound of fat is roughly 3,500 calories, so a daily 500-calorie deficit would equal about one pound of fat loss per week.</p>
      <p>Start small. A 200–300 calorie deficit is a good starting point to prevent your metabolism from slowing down too quickly. Over time, you can increase the deficit depending on how fast you want to progress. Because maintenance numbers from calorie calculators are just estimates, use trial and error to dial it in. If you're not losing weight after a week, try adjusting your calories slightly. If you're losing too fast, increase your calories a bit.</p>
      <p>Over time, your body will adapt to the lower intake by slowing metabolism. When this happens, you'll need to reassess and adjust your intake again to continue making progress.</p>
      <p>It’s also important to understand that <strong>it doesn’t matter what you eat as long as you stay within your calorie and macro goals</strong>. You can eat foods like pizza, burgers, or sweets and still lose weight — but these foods are usually calorie-dense and won’t keep you full for long. Eating healthier, whole foods makes it easier to stay within your deficit because they’re lower in calories and more filling.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance / Body Recomposition</h2>
      <p>Eating at your maintenance calories means you're consuming just enough to support your current weight — not gaining or losing. This is often referred to as the "body recomposition" stage. It allows your body to build muscle and lose fat simultaneously, but it’s a much slower process than cutting (fat loss) or bulking (muscle gain).</p>
      <p>The advantage of maintenance is that it's easier to sustain long-term. You're not restricting calories like in a deficit, so energy levels are generally better, and hunger is more manageable. It’s also less mentally taxing because you're not constantly thinking about food or adjusting your intake.</p>
      <p>In this stage, consistency is key. Focus on training hard and hitting your protein goal daily. Over time, your body will slowly shift its composition — adding muscle and shedding fat — especially if you’re newer to lifting or returning after time off.</p>

      <h2>Caloric Surplus / Weight Gain</h2>
      <p>If your goal is to build muscle and increase body weight, then eating in a caloric surplus is the most effective route. A surplus means you’re consuming more calories than your body needs to maintain its current weight — giving your body the extra energy it needs to support muscle growth and recovery.</p>
      <p>This method is ideal for putting on size and strength, but it’s important to understand that with a surplus, some fat gain is expected. The key is to manage the surplus so you’re gaining mostly muscle and minimizing excess fat. A small surplus of around 200–300 calories above maintenance is usually a good place to start.</p>
      <p>That said, if your main focus is simply to gain weight — especially if you’re underweight — then don’t stress too much about being precise. Eat as much as you can, as often as you can, and focus on getting in enough calories and protein throughout the day. In this case, eating calorie-dense foods like rice, peanut butter, nuts, pastas, granola, and liquid calories (like shakes) can help you hit your targets more easily.</p>
      <p>Just like with a deficit, this process takes trial and error. Track your weight weekly and adjust as needed. If you’re not gaining weight after a week or two, bump up your intake by another 100–200 calories per day.</p>
