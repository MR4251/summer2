        <h2>The Importance of Recovery</h2>
        <p>Recovery is just as important as training and diet. Your muscles don’t grow in the gym — they grow during rest. Without proper recovery, your performance will decline, you’ll feel more fatigued, and you increase the risk of injury or overtraining. Quality recovery helps repair muscle tissue, restore energy levels, and prepare your body for the next training session.</p>
        <p>Some of the key aspects of recovery include sleep, rest days, stretching, mobility work, hydration, and nutrition. Let’s break those down below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep is the foundation of recovery. Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. During deep sleep, your body releases growth hormone, repairs muscle tissue, and restores nervous system function. Inconsistent or poor sleep can negatively impact your strength, focus, and mood — making workouts feel harder and progress slower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Rest Days</h2>
        <p>Plan at least 1–2 full rest days each week. These give your muscles and nervous system time to recover and adapt. You can also do active recovery — such as walking, light stretching, or a light bike ride — to promote blood flow without putting stress on the body.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Stretching and Mobility</h2>
        <p>Stretching improves flexibility and can help reduce tightness and soreness. Focus on dynamic stretches before workouts and static stretches after workouts. Mobility work (like foam rolling or using resistance bands) can improve joint health, posture, and range of motion — all important for injury prevention and good lifting form.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Hydration</h2>
        <p>Staying hydrated helps regulate body temperature, transport nutrients, and remove waste products. Dehydration can make you feel sluggish and impair your workouts and recovery. Drink water throughout the day and consider electrolytes if you're sweating a lot or training intensely.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Nutrition and Recovery</h2>
        <p>Nutrition plays a big role in recovery. After training, aim to eat a balanced meal with protein and carbs to help rebuild muscle tissue and replenish glycogen. Protein supports muscle repair, while carbs help restore energy. Healthy fats also support hormone production and reduce inflammation.</p>
        <p>If you're in a deficit, it's even more important to get adequate protein and sleep since your body has fewer resources for recovery. Supplements like creatine, whey protein, or magnesium can also support recovery if needed — but whole food should always come first.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h2>Mind and Stress</h2>
        <p>Mental recovery matters too. High stress levels can interfere with your body’s ability to recover and build muscle. Find ways to manage stress like journaling, meditation, spending time in nature, or just taking time to unwind. Balance is key to sustainability in your fitness journey.</p>
