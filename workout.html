        <h2>Training Principles</h2>
        <p>To build muscle effectively, aim to train to failure or near failure in your working sets. This means pushing your muscles close to their limit while still maintaining proper form. Focus on hypertrophy by staying in the ideal rep range for muscle growth, which is typically 8–12 reps per set.</p>
        <p>Use explosive power during the lifting portion of the movement, and go slow and controlled on the negative (lowering) part to maximize time under tension. Always prioritize proper form over heavy weight. Starting too heavy can compromise form, reduce effectiveness, and increase the risk of injury.</p>
        <p>Progressive overload is key—gradually increase the weight over time. Choose a weight that puts you in your target rep range. If you exceed the top of the range, it's time to increase the weight. If you can’t reach the bottom of the range, reduce the weight. And remember: get a full range of motion, stretch the muscle at the bottom, and squeeze at the top of every rep.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
  <h2>Push Day</h2>
  <p>Push workouts target your chest, shoulders, and triceps. The goal is to emphasize controlled movement, progressive overload, and full range of motion while prioritizing form.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incline Press (Dumbbell, Barbell, or Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Focuses on the upper chest (clavicular head of the pectoralis major). Dumbbells allow for a greater range of motion and better contraction.</li>

    <li><strong>Shoulder Press (Dumbbell, Barbell, or Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Targets the front (anterior) deltoids. Also engages the triceps and upper chest depending on angle and grip.</li>

    <li><strong>Dips / Assisted Dips</strong> – 3 sets of 10–12 reps<br>
      Emphasizes the lower chest and triceps. Leaning forward slightly increases chest activation, while staying upright targets triceps more.</li>

    <li><strong>Chest Flys (Cable or Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 12–15 reps<br>
      Isolates the chest, especially the inner portion. Cables allow constant tension throughout the movement.</li>

    <li><strong>Lateral Raises (Dumbbell, Cable, or Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 12–15 reps<br>
      Targets the side (lateral) deltoids, helping develop shoulder width. Dumbbells are most common, but cables offer better tension throughout the motion.</li>

    <li><strong>Overhead Tricep Extension (Cable preferred)</strong> – 2–3 sets of 10–12 reps<br>
      Focuses on the long head of the triceps, which is best stretched with arms overhead. Use one or both arms depending on equipment and preference.</li>

    <li><strong>Rope Pushdowns</strong> – 2–3 sets of 12–15 reps<br>
      Targets the lateral (short) head of the triceps. Spread the rope at the bottom to maximize contraction and isolate the outer triceps.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <h2>Pull Day</h2>
  <p>Pull workouts focus on your back and biceps. These exercises help improve posture, pulling strength, and upper-body symmetry. Use controlled form, full range of motion, and weights that keep you within your target rep range.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pull-ups / Assisted Pull-ups</strong> – 2–3 sets to failure<br>
      Great as a warm-up and for building upper back and lat strength. Use a full range of motion and avoid swinging. Assisted machines or bands are great for beginners.</li>

    <li><strong>Lat Pulldowns</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Targets the lats (latissimus dorsi), especially when performed with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Lead with your elbows and bring the bar to your upper chest for full lat engagement.</li>

    <li><strong>Seated Cable Rows – Wide Grip</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Focuses on the mid to upper back, especially the rear delts, rhomboids, and traps. Flared elbows and a wide grip shift emphasis off the lats.</li>

    <li><strong>Seated Cable Rows – Close Grip</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      A close grip with tucked elbows shifts focus to the lats. Keep your torso upright and squeeze your back at the end of the movement.</li>

    <li><strong>Face Pulls (Cable Rope)</strong> – 3 sets of 12–15 reps<br>
      Targets the rear delts and upper traps. Pull the rope toward your face with elbows high and out. Helps with shoulder health and posture.</li>

    <li><strong>Incline Dumbbell Curls</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Emphasizes the long head of the biceps by keeping your arms behind your torso. Use a slow and controlled motion to feel the stretch and contraction.</li>

    <li><strong>Preacher Curls (Dumbbell, Barbell, or Machine)</strong> – 2–3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Targets the short head of the biceps. Using one arm at a time is ideal for correcting muscle imbalances, which are very common in the biceps.</li>

    <li><strong>Hammer Curls</strong> – 2–3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Works the brachialis and brachioradialis (muscles between the biceps and forearm). Also adds thickness to the arms. Can be done with dumbbells or cables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legs & Abs</h2>
  <p>This leg day workout is simple, effective, and beginner-friendly. It covers all major leg muscles and includes ab exercises to strengthen your core. Once you've built a foundation, we can help you expand your routine based on your specific goals — just contact us!</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leg Extensions (Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Focuses on the quadriceps (front of the thigh). Keep the movement slow and controlled to avoid using momentum.</li>

    <li><strong>Leg Curls (Machine)</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Targets the hamstrings (back of the thigh). Adjust the pad to align with your ankles and avoid lifting your hips off the seat.</li>

    <li><strong>Leg Press or Weighted Squats</strong> – 3 sets of 8–10 reps<br>
      Works the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Leg press is easier to learn for beginners, while squats help build overall strength and balance. Choose the one that feels safest and most effective for you.</li>

    <li><strong>Hip Abduction Machine</strong> – 3 sets of 10–12 reps<br>
      Targets the outer thighs and glutes. Sit upright and push your knees outward, pausing briefly at the top.</li>

    <li><strong>Hip Adduction Machine</strong> – 3 sets of 10–12 reps<br>
      Focuses on the inner thighs. Bring your legs together smoothly and avoid bouncing at the end of the motion.</li>

    <li><strong>Leg Raises</strong> – 3 sets to failure<br>
      A great ab exercise that targets the lower abdominal muscles. Can be done hanging, lying on the floor, or on a Roman chair depending on your level.</li>

    <li><strong>Seated Crunch Machine (Dual Action)</strong> – 3 sets of 12–15 reps<br>
      Focuses on the entire core by engaging both upper and lower abdominal muscles. Look for a machine that requires leg and torso movement together.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cardio</h2>
  <p>Cardio can be a great addition to your workout routine, but it's optional depending on your current diet and goals. If you’re aiming for fat loss, improved endurance, or just better heart health, cardio is worth including — but it should be done after your weight training session. Doing it before can drain your energy and negatively impact your lifts.</p>

  <p>You can choose any form of cardio that works for you: running, jump roping, cycling, the StairMaster — they’re all effective. For beginners, we recommend starting with a treadmill walk at a pace you can maintain comfortably. Over time, you can increase the incline and speed. A solid goal to build toward is walking at an incline of 10–11 with a speed of around 3.0.</p>

  <p>If your goal is to improve stamina, consider light jogging or alternating between walking and jogging intervals. Gradually increase your time, speed, or distance as your endurance improves.</p>
